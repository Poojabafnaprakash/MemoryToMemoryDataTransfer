A Design Example: Data Transfer from memory to memory     

Summary:
   Data-path and controller design is implemented using Hardware Description language - Verilog. We used ModelSim and Icarus tools to simulate and check the results. The controller is designed in such a way that it reads data from 8x8 Memory block and writes to 8x4 Memory block.

Programming Language: Verilog
